# Spam Filtering System

## Overview
The **Spam Filtering System** leverages machine learning to classify email content as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam). By combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and predictive modeling, the system delivers accurate classifications to enhance email filtering processes. The system includes a **Spring Boot** backend for handling API requests and a **Flask**-based machine learning engine for email classification.

## Features
- **Spam Detection**: Classifies emails as spam or ham based on their content.
- **NLP Analysis**: Analyzes email content using Natural Language Processing techniques to improve accuracy.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: Handles API requests and communicates with the classification engine.
- **Flask-based ML Engine**: Processes email data using a trained machine learning model.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Backend and ML engine are modular, ensuring independent improvements and scalability.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend API**: Spring Boot
- **Classification Engine**: Flask
- **Machine Learning Library**: Scikit-learn
- **Text Vectorization**: CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer
- **Model**: Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression
- **Database Management**: JPA (Java Persistence API) with MySQL
- **Frontend**: React.js for the user interface
- **APIs**: REST APIs for interaction between frontend, backend, and ML engine

## Architecture
### Spring Boot Backend:
- Handles HTTP requests for classifying emails.
- Communicates with the Flask-based machine learning engine for predictions.
- Provides responses to the frontend with classification results.

### Flask-based ML Engine:
- Implements email text preprocessing and machine learning classification.
- Trained using labeled datasets to distinguish between spam and ham emails.
- Integrates seamlessly with the Spring Boot API.

### Frontend (React.js):
- User-friendly interface for inputting email content.
- Displays real-time classification results.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-filtering-system.git
```
## Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL database credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spam_filter
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```
4. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   
## Flask Classification Engine

1. Navigate to the ml-engine folder.
2. Install the required Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Frontend Setup (React.js)
1. Navigate to the frontend folder.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Usage
## Testing via Postman
1. Open Postman.
2. Create a new POST request.
3. Set the request method to POST and enter the following URL:
```bash
http://localhost:8081/api/emails/classify
```
4. In the request body (JSON format), include:
```bash
{
  "emailText": "Congratulations! You've won a prize! Click here to claim your reward."
}
```
5. Click Send. The response will return the classification:
```bash
{
  "classification": "spam"
}
```
